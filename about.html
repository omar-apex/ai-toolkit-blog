  </div>

  <article class="article-body">
    <p>AI Toolkit is a practical resource for people who want to build, deploy, and manage AI-powered automation. We focus on real workflows rather than theoretical possibilities — things you can set up today, with actual cost breakdowns and performance data.</p>

    <p>Our content covers AI agent frameworks, VPS hosting for autonomous systems, SEO tools for content operations, and the infrastructure decisions that make or break an automation project.</p>

    <p>Every tool recommendation on this site comes from hands-on testing. We run the software, measure the performance, and report what we find. Some links on this site are affiliate links, which means we may earn a commission if you purchase through them. This does not affect our editorial judgment — we recommend what works, and we are transparent about the relationship.</p>
